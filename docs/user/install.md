# Install Spindle

Spindle runs coding agents on your computer and lets you control them from its
desktop, web, or mobile app. Set up the machine where the agents will work first.

## Requirements

Command-line use, SSH hosts, and WSL backends need Node.js 22.16+ (22.x), 23.11+
(23.x), or 24.10 and later. The native desktop app includes its server runtime.

You need an installed, authenticated provider before starting a thread. You can
launch Spindle and configure providers afterwards.

## Get Spindle

Use builds published in the [Spindle fork's releases](https://github.com/meik1998dev/t3code/releases),
or run this repository from source:

```bash
vp i
vp run dev
```

The upstream `npx t3`, Homebrew, winget, and AUR packages install **T3 Code**, not
this fork. Existing `t3` command names and `T3CODE_*` configuration variables are
retained for compatibility; the display name is Spindle.

## Desktop app

Build from this repository with `vp run dist:desktop:dmg` on macOS, or use a
matching fork release when available.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Choose a WSL distro in **Settings → Connections** to run agents and projects
there. Install Node.js and provider CLIs inside that distro. Spindle installs its
matching server runtime there automatically; the first launch after an app
update can take longer.

### Open a project from a terminal

With the desktop app already running on the same machine:

```bash
t3 app
```

This opens a new thread for the current directory, adding the project if needed.
Pass a path, such as `t3 app ../my-project`, to open another directory. It requires
the desktop app, so a standalone server or an SSH session is not enough. If the
command cannot reach the app, start or update the desktop app and try again.

## Mobile app

The upstream **T3 Code** mobile clients are available from the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t3-code-remote-claude-more/id6787819824) or
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t3tools.t3code).
For Spindle-branded mobile builds, build `apps/mobile` from this repository.
The phone connects to a server on another machine. Follow
[remote access](./remote-access.md) to link it through T3 Connect or a pairing URL.

## Providers

Open **Settings → Providers** in the web or desktop app, select the environment,
and enable the provider you want. Installation, login, and configuration belong
to that environment's machine, even when you connect from a phone or another
computer.

| Provider    | Install and authenticate                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex       | Install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), then run `codex login`.        |
| Claude      | Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), then run `claude auth login`. |
| Cursor      | Install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), then run `agent login`.                        |
| Grok Build  | Install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli), then run `grok login`.                           |
| OpenCode    | Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then run `opencode auth login`.                     |
| Antigravity | Install and sign in with Google from Spindle's provider settings.                            |

Provider CLIs must be on the server's `PATH`. If Spindle cannot find one, set its
**Binary path** in provider settings, especially when using a version manager.
Cursor's executable is `cursor-agent`, although its login command is
`agent login`. Antigravity can use its managed runtime without a `PATH` entry.

When a provider CLI is behind its latest release, its provider card shows the
available version. **Update now** appears only when Spindle can tell which
installer owns the CLI (its own update command, Homebrew, or a global npm, pnpm,
bun, or Vite+ install) and runs that installer. Otherwise update the CLI the same
way you installed it. Homebrew installs compare against the version Homebrew
offers, which can trail the npm release by a few hours.

Add another provider instance for a separate account or configuration. Each
instance can have its own environment variables, such as API keys or a custom
base URL. Mark secret values as sensitive; after saving, Spindle does not display
their original values.

For provider-specific setup and accounts, see [Codex](./providers-codex.md),
[Claude](./providers-claude.md), [OpenCode](./providers-opencode.md), and
[Antigravity](./providers-antigravity.md).

Grok models that support adjustable reasoning show a **Reasoning** section in the composer
settings pill beside the model picker. The levels come from the installed Grok Build CLI.
